# Javascript Discord Bot `(V14.14.1)`
**This is a fivem discord bot. This project is fully open to development and you can use "Fork".** This project uses mongoose and node.js. Don't forget to fill in the `config.json` and `.env` files. You can develop it as you wish.

## Significant:
- `Config.json>Guild_ID` & `Config.json>Admin` Make sure to fill in comments and **never delete** them!
You can delete other parts, but you need to fix the errors that appear.
- You can add Discord events under the "events" folder ([source](https://discord.js.org/docs/packages/discord.js/14.15.2/Events:Enum)). The folder you will create under the "events" folder must contain the event name. You can name the .js file inside as you wish. `events>ready>event-testing.js`
- When you want to add a new command, you can open as many folders as you want under the "commands" folder or add your new commands to old folders!
The sample command is shown in the `src>commands>admin>test-command.js` file.
